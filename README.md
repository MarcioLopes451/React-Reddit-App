# RedditApp

This is my first react project and I'm glad i've completed it. I've learnt soo much from this project went through soo many struggles but I got to the end of the tunnel.

I designed a figma template of the design of the app in my view and have a documented planning sheet on how I will go about completing this project. As of this writing, there is still small improvements that I will address but I just wanted to deploy this project soo many others can see. I'm happy for any critis and any improvements.
